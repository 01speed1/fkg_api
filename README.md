# fkg_api

## Purpose

This API serves a frontend to manage support cases that may arise. There are two types of cases: "Support" and "Business Requirements".

You can test the API at the endpoint:
[https://fkg-api.onrender.com](https://fkg-api.onrender.com)

## Important Note

Please note that since the API is hosted on a free plan on Render, it may take some time to start up if the DNS has not been accessed for a while, approximately 1 minute. This does not mean that the API is down, it just needs to be resumed.

Make sure to wait for a few moments if you encounter any delays when accessing the API.


## Documentation

You can access the documentation for the API endpoints at [https://fkg-api.onrender.com/docs](https://fkg-api.onrender.com/docs). This provides detailed information about each endpoint, including request and response schemas, as well as the ability to interact with the API directly from the documentation page.

Make sure to explore the documentation to understand the available endpoints and their functionalities.

**Remember to add a screenshot of the documentation generated by FastAPI here.**

## Description

This is a Python API that uses the FastAPI framework and connects to a PostgreSQL database.

## Running Locally with Docker and Visual Studio Code

To set up a development environment with a custom Python 3.9 image and a PostgreSQL image, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the repository:**

   ```bash
   git clone <REPOSITORY_URL>
   cd fkg_api
   ```

2. **Set up the development environment:**

   Make sure you have Docker and Docker Compose installed on your machine.

3. **Build and start the containers:**

   ```bash
   docker-compose up --build
   ```

4. **Access the API:**

   The API will be available at [http://localhost:8000](http://localhost:8000).

5. **Setup in Visual Studio Code:**

   Open the project in Visual Studio Code and make sure you have the following extensions installed:

   - Python
   - Docker

   You can use the [`devcontainer.json`](command:_github.copilot.openRelativePath?%5B%7B%22scheme%22%3A%22file%22%2C%22authority%22%3A%22%22%2C%22path%22%3A%22%2Fhome%2Foscar%2FProjects%2FFKG%2Ffkg_api%2F.devcontainer%2Fdevcontainer.json%22%2C%22query%22%3A%22%22%2C%22fragment%22%3A%22%22%7D%2C%22b1f3bfa7-82d5-4e5b-8e6f-91a36a7be344%22%5D "/home/oscar/Projects/FKG/fkg_api/.devcontainer/devcontainer.json") file to configure a custom development container.

   ```json
   {
     "name": "My API Container",
     "workspaceFolder": "/code",
     "mounts": [
       {
         "source": "${localWorkspaceFolder}",
         "target": "/code",
         "type": "bind"
       }
     ],
     "customizations": {
       "vscode": {
         "settings": {
           "extensions": ["ms-python.python"]
         }
       }
     },
     "postCreateCommand": "pip install -r /code/requirements.txt",
     "dockerComposeFile": "../docker-compose.yml",
     "service": "main",
     "runServices": ["db", "pgadmin"],
     "overrideCommand": true
   }
   ```

## Additional Notes

* Although the API has integrated tests in most files, it does not achieve 100% coverage.
* I would have liked to manage the relationships between tables better, but as I was writing the code, I didn't see it necessary for the objective.
* Several ideas were left out, such as the possibility of replicating the company's business logic and allowing the web interface to communicate with and modify the database directly.
* I tested everything under containers, so I cannot guarantee that the application will run correctly if you install Python and PostgreSQL directly on your machine.
